# Network-traffic-capture-and-analysis-with-Wireshark
## AIM:
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark in order to observe protocols, packets, and potential anomalies.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Install Wireshark using the command:

### Step 2:
Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for live traffic capture.

### Step 3:
Start the capture, apply filters (like http, tcp, ip.addr == x.x.x.x) to analyze specific traffic, and stop the capture after observing relevant data.

## PROGRAM:
Wireshark Packet Capture and Filter Usage

## OUTPUT:
Captured Packets with Protocol Analysis and Detailed Packet Info









## RESULT:
Network traffic was successfully captured and analyzed using Wireshark.
