## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Install Wireshark using the command:

### Step 2:
Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for live traffic capture.

### Step 3:
Start the capture, apply filters (like http, tcp, ip.addr == x.x.x.x) to analyze specific traffic, and stop the capture after observing relevant data.

## PROGRAM:
